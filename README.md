# Reminder-Quotient
Find quotient and reminder using C Program:
## Working:
- In this program,the user is asked to enter two integers (Dividend and Divisor).
- They are stored in variables Divident and Divisor respectively.
- Then the quotient is evaluated using ( / division operator),and stored in quotient.
- Similarly,the remainder is evaluated usin ( % modulo operator) and stored in remainder.
## Result:
Finally, the quotient and remainder are displayed using printf().
